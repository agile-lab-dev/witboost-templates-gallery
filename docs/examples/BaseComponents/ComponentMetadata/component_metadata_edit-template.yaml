        This wizard will allow you to edit the metadata for a previously created Component.

        Most metadata is editable but some (like the name, domain, data product etc) are not; their fields will be read-only.

        Some of the files in the component's repository cannot be updated by this wizard, namely:
        - **Documentation**: `README.md`, `docs/index.md`, etc
        - **CI/CD**: `.gitlab-ci-yaml`
        You need to take care of updating these yourself, as given their nature it's hard to do automatically and they are often edited manually after the component's creation.

            A component could depend on other components in the same Data Product. This information will be used to deploy the components in such an order that their dependencies already exist.

            **Warning**: be careful not to select this component as its own dependency, otherwise it will become undeployable until you edit it again and remove that circular dependency.
